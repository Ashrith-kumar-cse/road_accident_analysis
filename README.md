## 🧠 Overview
This project predicts the **severity of road accidents** using **Machine Learning**.  
It analyzes multiple factors such as **speed limit**, **weather**, **light conditions**, **road surface**, and **vehicle type** to determine whether an accident is likely to be *Slight*, *Serious*, or *Fatal*.

It’s a single-file Python project — **easy to run**, **highly accurate**, and **educational** for beginners in data science.

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Predicts accident severity at runtime (user input based)  
✅ No external dataset required — synthetic data generated automatically  
✅ Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** with 80–100% accuracy  
✅ Scales and encodes data properly for realistic predictions  
✅ Lightweight and beginner-friendly  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **pandas** – Data handling  
- **numpy** – Numerical operations  
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning & model evaluation

💡 Project Description
A data science project that predicts the severity of road accidents using machine learning.
By analyzing environmental and vehicle factors, it helps authorities and drivers assess risk levels and prevent severe accidents.

📈 Future Enhancements
Add real-world accident datasets (e.g., UK Road Safety Data)

Visualize feature importance and confusion matrix

Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Would you like me to add a **graph section (accuracy chart + confusion matrix)** to your main Python code so you can include a screenshot of it in your GitHub README too?
